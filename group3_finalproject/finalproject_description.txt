Our game design for the final project is a ping pong game. We have two game modes, single player and two player. Use the W/S key and the Up and Down arrow to move the two paddles up and down the screen to hit the ping pong ball. The paddles will have hierarchy to them as well with the design. There will be an interactive main menu that allows to quit, restart, and pause the game.

Keyboard interactivity is present in the keystrokes to move the paddles, as well as the spacebar, which triggers the pause menu. Additionally, sound effects can be toggled with the V key and music with the M key. There are 3 GUI menus: home, pause, and win. The home menu allows you to select which mode to play, the pause menu allows you to quit, restart, or pause, and the win menu allows you to replay or return to home. The win screen is triggered in the single player mode once the ball passes the player's paddle, and in the two-player mode once one player reaches 10 points. There are animation hierarchies present in the circle moving inside the ball and the circles inside the paddles. Data is inputted in the single player mode, where scores are stored, and outputted in this mode, as the high score is displayed.

The ballMovement class is responsible for ball behavior, boardGame class for a session of the game, button for the buttons in the GUIS, home for the home menu GUI, menu for the general menu GUI, options for the pause menu GUI, win for the win menu GUI, singlePlayerData for storing data, and sprite for the animation at the beginning animation. We faced challenges with figuring out the physics system for the ball, and how to ensure it properly interacted with the paddles. 

Abdon was responsible for the physics system and paddle movement, Christina was responsible for the sound and paddle hierarchy, and Sydney was resposible for the GUIS, data storage, and ball hierarchy.
