This game will have a character that will be catching falling items from the sky. The character will move left and right with left and right arrows. Different shapes of items will be falling from the sky and each item will be worth differently. The player can make the basket invisible, via the Shift key which prevents the catching of any items and accruing of any points. Depending on the final score, the player will get either 1, 2 or 3 stars and the game will be over, with the option to restart. 5 points earns one star, 15 earns two stars, and 25 earns three stars. The pause menu can be activated with the space bar, allowing the player to restart, quit, or resume. Throughout the game, the player's score is displayed in the top right corner.
