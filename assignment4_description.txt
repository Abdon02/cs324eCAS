Sydney was responsible for the sun class. The sun class is used to draw out a sun with a central orb and rays around it. It is customizable in starting position, starting radius, minimum radius, maximum radius, grow speed, translation speed, rotation speed, central color, and the ray color. The sun object moves horizontally across the screen, looping around once it encounters the edge of the screen. It also grows the object until the maximum radius is hit, at which point it shrinks the object until the minimum radius is hit. Finally, the rays rotate around the orb in a pinwheel motion, following it as the shape moves and grows/shrinks.
