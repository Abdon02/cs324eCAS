Sydney was responsible for the sun class. The sun class is used to draw out a sun with a central orb and rays around it. It is customizable in starting position, starting radius, minimum radius, maximum radius, grow speed, translation speed, rotation speed, central color, and the ray color. The sun object moves horizontally across the screen, looping around once it encounters the edge of the screen. It also grows the object until the maximum radius is hit, at which point it shrinks the object until the minimum radius is hit. Finally, the rays rotate around the orb in a pinwheel motion, following it as the shape moves and grows/shrinks.
Christina was responsible for the clouds and rain class. The Clouds class is used ti draw out three circles that connect to make it look like clouds. The class has a customizable, location, radius displacement, radius, translation speed, grow and shrink speed, and color. The clouds move horizontal across the screen and grows and shrinks depending on the value of the radius displacement and the speed. Once the cloud hits the edge of the screen, the cloud resets and goes across the screen again. Also, in the rain class, the raindrops has the same variables and moves across the scene with the clouds and resets when the raindrops touch the ground.
